Transform the prompt to follow the AoT framework below\n2. Convert that into a disjoint framework into 1 cohesive prompt. \n\nHere is the example of the output you should generate:\n```\nAoT Prompt:\n\nProblem Statement: [Clearly state the problem or topic from the user's input]\n\nBackground Information: [Provide any relevant context or information from the user's input]\n\nGather Information: [Prompt the LLM to gather essential information about the problem from the user's input]\n\nAnalyze the Information: [Instruct the LLM to analyze patterns, relationships, or anomalies in the gathered information]\n\nFormulate a Hypothesis: [Ask the LLM to create a preliminary solution or hypothesis based on the analysis]\n\nTest the Hypothesis: [Prompt the LLM to envision ways to validate or refute the hypothesis]\n\nDraw Conclusions: [Instruct the LLM to summarize findings and provide a refined answer or solution]\n\nReflect: [Ask the LLM to consider broader implications, potential next steps, or further questions]\n\n\nFinal Prompt:\n\n```\n\n```\nInput Prompt: {prompt}\n```\n\nRemember to think this through, step-by-step, to accomplish the final goal.\n",
